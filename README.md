# **StatHack - LLM Comparison Prediction**

Welcome to the **StatHack Hackathon Project Repository**! ðŸš€ This project was developed as part of the **StatHack** event organized by **Cultrang**. The challenge involves building a machine learning model to predict the "winner" between two responses generated by large language models (LLMs) or determine if it is a tie.

---

## **Problem Statement**

The task is to compare responses generated by two LLMs (`model_a` and `model_b`) for a given input `prompt`. A human judge selects the "winner" based on the relevance, quality, and accuracy of the responses, or declares a tie if both responses are equally good (or equally bad).  

Our goal is to build a model capable of predicting the winning response (or a tie) for each test example.  

### **Dataset Details**
- **train.csv:** Contains the training data with the following columns:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for each row.
  - `model_a` and `model_b`: The two LLMs being compared.
  - `prompt`: The input text provided to both models.
  - `response_a` and `response_b`: Responses generated by the respective models.
  - `winner_a`, `winner_b`, `winner_tie`: Binary columns indicating whether model `a`, model `b`, or a tie was chosen as the winner.

- **test.csv:** Contains the test data with the following columns:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for each row.
  - `prompt`: The input prompt provided to the models.
  - `response_a` and `response_b`: The two LLM-generated responses.

- **sample_submission.csv:** Contains the required submission format, with columns:
  - `id`: Unique row identifier.
  - `winner_model_a`: Predicted probability of model `a` winning.
  - `winner_model_b`: Predicted probability of model `b` winning.
  - `winner_tie`: Predicted probability of a tie.

Due to the **large file size** of the train and test datasets, they could not be uploaded directly to this repository. You can download them from the following link:
